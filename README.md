# stm32-mini-pill
This is a development board for (LQFP-48) STM32 microcontrollers like the STM32F103C8T6 and STM32F072C8T6.
It is effectively 1/2 of the infamous 'blue-pill'.

Design was done using KiCad.

PCBs are available at OSHPARK (or upload the included gerber.zip to your favorite board house):
